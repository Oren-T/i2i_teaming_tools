# Email Templates

Draft text for automated email notifications. Use token substitution for placeholders.

**Structure:** Each template is stored as a separate Google Doc. First line = subject line, remaining lines = email body. Apps Script parses by splitting on newlines.

**IMPORTANT:** Newlines in the Google Doc are automatically converted to `<br>` tags. Do NOT add `<br>` at the end of lines — just use natural line breaks. Use `<b>`, `<a href="...">`, etc. for inline formatting only.

## Parsing Function

Apps Script function to parse email templates from Google Docs; note, `sendEmail` should use HTML content rendering for full support of formatting:

```javascript
/**
 * Parses an email template from a Google Doc
 * @param {string} templateDocId - Google Doc ID containing the template
 * @returns {Object} Object with 'subject' and 'body' properties
 */
function getEmailTemplate(templateDocId) {
  const doc = DocumentApp.openById(templateDocId);
  const text = doc.getBody().getText();
  const lines = text.split('\n');
  
  // First non-empty line is the subject
  const subject = lines.find(line => line.trim() !== '') || '';
  
  // Find where body starts (after first non-empty line)
  const firstLineIndex = lines.findIndex(line => line.trim() !== '');
  const bodyLines = lines.slice(firstLineIndex + 1);
  const body = bodyLines.join('\n').trim();
  
  return { subject: subject.trim(), body: body };
}
```
