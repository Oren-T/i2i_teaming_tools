## Project Management Tool — User Guide

### Who this guide is for
This guide is for staff who **submit projects**, **own projects**, or **support projects** using the Project Management Tool in Google Workspace (Google Sheets, Google Drive, Google Calendar, and email).

---

## Section 1 — How to think about the tool

### The big idea: a “recipe for success”
Think of each project like baking.

- **The outcome**: you want something specific at the end (the cupcakes).
- **The ingredients & tools**: people, materials, files, and information.
- **The recipe steps**: small, clear actions you can complete and check off.

This tool helps you keep those pieces in one place so projects don’t depend on “who remembers what.”

---

### Key terms (plain language)

#### Project Directory (the cookbook index)
A **single Google Sheet** that lists all projects in one place.

Use it to:
- **Find a project** quickly (by title, deadline, category, assignees).
- **See what’s on track / stuck / late**.
- **Update key fields** (deadline, assigned to, status).

#### Project (the recipe)
A **project** is a meaningful piece of work with:
- a clear outcome
- a deadline
- one or more owners (assignees)
- supporting materials

Examples: “Submit LCAP update to the board”, “Complete WASC evidence review”, “Order and distribute intervention supplies”.

#### Action (the recipe steps)
An **action** is a single, measurable step that moves the project forward.

Good actions are:
- small enough to finish
- specific enough that someone else could do them
- measurable (“Send draft to X”, “Collect 3 quotes”, “Upload final version to folder”)

#### Project Folder (the kitchen counter)
A **Google Drive folder** created for each project. This is the “one place” where project materials live.

Put things here like:
- drafts, slides, PDFs
- notes and agendas
- evidence, data exports
- final deliverables

#### Project File (the recipe card)
A **Google Sheet created inside the Project Folder** for that specific project.

It includes tabs like:
- **Overview** (what it is, why it matters, who’s involved)
- **Action Plan** (the steps)
- **Meeting Notes** (a running log)
- **Progress Monitoring** (metrics/checkpoints)
- **Resources & Glossary** (links, definitions)

---

### How the pieces fit together
- **Project Directory (Sheet)**: the master list of every project
- **Project Folder (Drive)**: the home for all files for that project
- **Project File (Sheet in the folder)**: optional-but-recommended “recipe card” for the project

When you get an email about a project, the **Project Folder link** is your fastest route to everything.

---

### A simple working rhythm (how to work a project)

#### Step 1: Confirm the finish line
In the **Project File → Overview**, make sure these are clear:
- **What is the deliverable?** (What will exist when this is done?)
- **Who needs it and by when?**
- **What does “good” look like?**

If you can’t answer these quickly, capture the open question in **Meeting Notes** (or the project’s **Notes** field) and follow up with the requester.

#### Step 2: Turn the work into clear actions
In the **Action Plan**, write steps that are:
- **discrete** (one step, one output)
- **measurable** (you can tell if it’s done)
- **owned** (someone is responsible)

If an action is too big, split it.

#### Step 3: Keep materials in one place
Use the **Project Folder** as the single source of truth.

A simple habit that works:
- Put the link to the key doc (or final deliverable) at the top of the **Meeting Notes**.

#### Step 4: Keep status honest
In the **Project Directory**, use **Project Status** as your shared language:
- **Project Assigned**: it’s been created and assigned
- **On Track**: no concerns
- **Behind Schedule**: risk is emerging
- **Stuck**: blocked (needs help/decision)
- **Late**: deadline passed and not complete
- **Complete**: finished

Tip: Status is not a performance review—it’s a communication tool.

### Good habits (make the system work for you)

#### Good “requester” habits
When you submit a project, try to include:
- **a title that names the deliverable** (not just the topic)
- **a deadline that reflects reality**
- **a description with context** (who it’s for, why it matters, what format)
- **any starting materials** (links, examples, templates)

#### Good “assignee” habits
- Keep **Project Status** current.
- When stuck, write the blocker as a question: “We need a decision on X by Y.”
- Keep drafts and finals in the **Project Folder**.
- Use the **Project File** to make handoffs easy.

## Section 2 — How to use the tool

### Your first 5 minutes

#### If you are submitting a new project
1. Open the **Project Submission Form**.
2. Fill in:
   - title
   - description
   - who it’s assigned to
   - deadline
   - category (LCAP/SPSA/WASC/etc., depending on your setup)
3. Submit.

What happens next (automatically):
- The project appears in the **Project Directory**.
- A **Project Folder** is created in Google Drive.
- A **Project File** may be created in that folder (if your district uses one).
- Assignees receive an **email** with the project details and folder link.
- A **calendar event** is created on the deadline date and invites the project participants.

#### If you were assigned a project
1. Open the email and click the **Project Folder** link.
2. Open the **Project File** (if present) and read the **Overview** first.
3. Add the next 1–3 **actions** to the Action Plan.
4. In the **Project Directory**, set the **Project Status** to match reality (On Track / Behind Schedule / Stuck / etc.).

---

### Create a project (two ways)

#### Option A: Use the Project Submission Form (recommended)
- Submit the form.
- That’s it—automation processes it immediately.

#### Option B: Add it directly in the Project Directory (manual entry)
Use this if you need to create a project without the form - which may be the case if you are bulk-creating projects.

1. Open the Project Directory spreadsheet and go to the tab named **Project Management Sheet**.
2. Add a new row below the headers.
3. Fill in the essentials:
   - **Title**
   - **Description**
   - **Assigned to** (one or more people)
   - **Requested by**
   - **Deadline**
   - **Category** (if used)
4. Set **Automation Status** to **Ready**.
5. Wait for automation (within ~10 minutes), or use the menu **Project Management Tool → Run Now**.

When processing finishes, the tool will create the folder/calendar invite/send email the same way it does for form submissions.

---

### Where to update what (so everyone stays aligned)

#### Update in the Project Directory when…
- the **deadline** changes
- the **assignees** change
- you want leadership/partners to see a quick progress signal (status)

#### Update in the Project File when…
- you want a clear **action plan**
- you want to capture **meeting notes**
- you need to track **metrics or checkpoints**

#### Update in the Project Folder when…
- you have any document someone else might need later
- you’re producing drafts/final versions

---

### Emails, reminders, and calendar events (what to expect)
The tool can send:
- **New project assignment emails** (with the folder link)
- **Reminder emails** as deadlines approach
- **Status change digests** (a daily summary when statuses change)
- **Update notifications** when key fields are changed and re-synced
- **Cancellation notifications** if a project is cancelled

The tool also creates a **calendar event on the due date** and invites project participants.

---

### Automation Status (keep it simple)
Most users only need three options:
- **Ready**: used when a new project row is manually completed and should be processed
- **Updated**: used after changing key fields so the tool can re-sync calendar + notifications
- **Created**: normal “everything is set up” state

If you never manually add projects to the sheet, you’ll mostly use **Updated** (and even that only when changing key fields).

---

### Common scenarios (step-by-step)

#### “The deadline changed”
1. In the Project Directory, update the **Deadline**.
2. Set **Automation Status** to **Updated**.
3. Wait for automation (or use **Project Management Tool → Run Now**).

#### “We added or removed people”
1. Update **Assigned to**.
2. Set **Automation Status** to **Updated**.
3. Wait for automation (or use **Run Now**).

#### “We finished”
1. Set **Project Status** to **Complete**.
2. Put the final deliverable (or a link to it) in the **Project Folder**.

#### “This project should be cancelled”
1. Set **Automation Status** to **Delete (Notify)** (if you want attendees notified) or **Delete (Don’t Notify)**.
2. Wait for automation (or use **Run Now**).

#### “A new person needs access (or someone’s access should be removed)”
This is usually handled by someone with admin ownership of the Project Directory.

1. Open the **Directory** tab in the Project Directory spreadsheet.
2. Add (or update) the person’s row:
   - Name
   - Email Address
   - Set **Active?** to **Yes** (or set to **No** to remove access)
   - Choose their access/role fields (wording varies by district)
3. Run **Project Management Tool → Refresh Permissions**.
4. If they should appear in the submission form dropdown, run **Project Management Tool → Sync Form Dropdowns** (or wait for the automatic refresh).

## FAQs

### “What’s the difference between Project Status and Automation Status?”
- **Project Status** is for humans (On Track, Stuck, Complete).
- **Automation Status** is for the system (Ready, Created, Updated).

### “Where do I find the project folder?”
- In the **assignment email** (fastest), or in the Project Directory row if you have access.

### “How long does automation take?”
- Form submissions are usually processed right away.
- Manual entries are typically processed within ~10 minutes, or you can use **Run Now**.

### “What does ‘Run Now’ do?”
- It tells the tool to immediately process projects that are waiting for automation (new, updated, or delete requests).

### “What does ‘Refresh Permissions’ do?”
- It re-applies access/sharing based on the Directory tab (use after adding/removing staff or changing roles).

### “What does ‘Sync Form Dropdowns’ do?”
- It refreshes the submission form’s dropdown options (like staff names and categories) from the Directory/Codes tabs. However, most of the time, this should happen automatically.
